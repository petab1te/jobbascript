# jobbascript
It's a script that gets you a job

Requires a configured google places api key

Finds businesses in a radius around a location and then does an extremely dumb dir crawl on them for job pages. Presents it's findings at the end so you may go apply to jobs.

It would be awesome to extend the script to partially fill out application information for the user, but I am done with the script for now.
